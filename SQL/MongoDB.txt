2. db.democollection.findOne() - left empty it will return the first document in the collection.
3. db.democollection.find({hobby:"listening to music"}) - querying/filtering

	- We use a 1 to include a field and 0 to exclude a field.
	- You cannot use both 0 and 1 in the same object. The only exception is the _id field. You should either specify the fields you would like to include or the fields you would like to exclude.
5. db.democollection.find({},{name:0,hobby:1}) -- X : cannot use both 0 and 1 in same object.
6. db.democollection.find({},{_id:0,hobby:1}) -- It works: _id is the only exception


--update

db.democollection.updateOne({name:"Pradeepa"},{$set:{hobby:"gaming"}})
