The popularity of NoSQL has been driven by the following reasons:

-The pace of development with NoSQL databases can be much faster than with a SQL database
-The structure of many different forms of data is more easily handled and evolved with a NoSQL database
-The amount of data in many applications cannot be served affordably by a SQL database
-The scale of traffic and need for zero downtime cannot be handled by SQL
-New application paradigms can be more easily supported


Here are the four main types of NoSQL databases:

- Document databases
- Key-value stores
- Column-oriented databases
- Graph databases
